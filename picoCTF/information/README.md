# Scan Surprise [picoCTF]

## Description
In this task we get a `.jpg` file that supposedly contains a flag. The task was to recover the flag contained by the image.

## Approach

1. First, I opened the image using the standard image viewer of Ubuntu. The picture did not reveal anything special.

2. I suspected that the meta data of the image might have been changed. I used **exiftool** to reveal the metadata.

## Steps
- Open image:
```bash
xdg-open cat.jpg

```
- Opening the image binary data in **ghex** did not reveal anything special

- Inspecting the metadata:
```bash
exiftool cat.jpg
```
resulted in
```bash

```

This revealed that the **Licens** was not in the expected format. Normally, this tag is used to store licensing information. In this case, the value was Base64 encoded.

- Decode the value:
```bash
echo 'cGljb0NURnt0aGVfbTN0YWRhdGFfMXNfbW9kaWZpZWR9' | base64 -d
```

which reveals the flag: `picoCTF{the_m3tadata_1s_modified}`
## Solution
**Flag**: `picoCTF{the_m3tadata_1s_modified}`
