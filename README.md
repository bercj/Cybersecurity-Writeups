# CTF Writeups

This repository contains my personal writeups for various Capture The Flag (CTF) platforms and challenges.  

## Table of contents
- [Structure](#structure)  
- [Contents of a challenge folder](#contents-of-a-challenge-folder) 
- [Notes & disclaimer](#notes--disclaimer)  

## Structure
Top-level folders are platform names (or event names). Each platform contains categories (optional) and per-challenge directories.

## Contents of a challenge folder
Each challenge folder typically contains:
- `README.md` — detailed writeup with steps and explanation  
- `exploit.py`, `solve.py`, or similar — scripts used to solve the challenge  
- `challenge-files/` — any input files, binaries, images, etc. (only included when redistribution is allowed)  
- `notes.txt` or `capture.log` (optional) — scratch notes, debugging logs

## Notes & disclaimer
- Environment: Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS [Different environments are declared in the specific CTF's description]
- These writeups are for education and research only. Do not use them to attack systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.  
- I may omit challenge assets when redistribution is not allowed by the original platform.
